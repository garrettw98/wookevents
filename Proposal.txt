# Midtown Loud Social Media Growth Proposal (Updated)

## Executive Summary

I am proposing a strategic initiative to **revitalize Midtown Loud's social media presence and amplify brand visibility** by:

- Hosting monthly experimental bass music events at the Midtown Sacramento shop, in collaboration with **Wook Events**, which I operate.

This dual approach leverages the overlapping demographics between the experimental bass music scene and Midtown Loud's target market to:

- **Maximize brand exposure through immersive events**
- Increase social media engagement and follower growth
- Drive online sales expansion

- **Instagram Following**: 38.3k followers with currently low engagement
- **Target Market**: Middle-class clientele aged 21-60
- **Location Advantage**: Positioned in an affluent area with potential for enhanced brand visibility and event attendance
- **Consistent Retail Growth**: Recently opened in February 2024 and has seen month-over-month growth

## Objectives

1. **Amplify Brand Visibility**: Elevate Midtown Loud's presence both locally and nationally through events and social media, turning the shop into a cultural hub.
2. **Increase Social Media Engagement**: Boost relevant followers and engagement on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, X, and other relevant platforms.
3. **Enhance Physical Store Awareness**: Use events to attract foot traffic to the store and raise local brand recognition.
4. **Drive Online Sales Growth**: Expand nationwide online cannabis bag sales through increased brand exposure.
5. **Establish Brand Authority**: Position Midtown Loud as a trendsetter in the experimental bass music and cannabis communities.
6. **Lay Foundations for Future Expansion**: Prepare for growth into the "American Weed" brand and potential cannabis ventures.

## Proposed Strategy
